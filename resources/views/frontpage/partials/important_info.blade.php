Insurance Information

Insurance information
All rental cars must have Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and Theft Protection (TP). Each policy will be either:

    included or
    purchasable from the rental company, or
    provided by another company (e.g. your credit card company).

Collision Damage Waiver (CDW)

If the car’s bodywork gets damaged, the most you’ll pay towards repairs covered by the Collision Damage Waiver is the damage excess. This cover is only valid if you stick to the terms of the rental agreement. It doesn’t cover other parts of the car (e.g. glass, wheels, interior, roof or undercarriage), or charges (e.g. for towing or off-road time), or anything in the car (e.g. child seats, GPS devices or personal belongings).
Theft Cover

If the car is stolen, the most you’ll pay towards replacement costs covered by the policy is the theft excess. This cover is only valid if you stick to the terms of the rental agreement.
Third-Party Liability (TPL)

Covers the driver’s liability for any injuries and property damage that are included in the policy. It does not cover injuries to the driver or damage to the rental car. This cover is only valid if you stick to the terms of the rental agreement.
Loss or Damage

If the car is stolen, or seriously damaged, or damaged in an incident involving someone else, please contact the rental company and the police immediately. If you can\'t provide the necessary documents from the police, you\'ll be liable for the full cost of replacing/repairing the car. If the car gets slightly damaged, and no-one else is involved, please contact the rental company immediately.

The rental company is not liable for the loss of / theft of / damage to any belongings in the car, during or after the rental.

Damage to the car will be charged for by the car hire company after it is dropped off - and will incur a Damage Administration fee on top of the amount deducted from the excess.

Not included in the rental cover (CDW & TP)
Loss of / theft of / damage to: keys, aerials, jack, safety triangles and vests, windscreen wipers, petrol cap, luggage covers, or any other fixed or mobile component of the car.
Mileage / Kilometres

Your rental includes unlimited free kilometres.

Changing the length of your rental can affect how many kilometres you can drive for free. It can also affect how much you will pay for each additional kilometre.'

This section shows charges that you’ll pay at the counter because of (a) where you\'re picking your car up, (b) who\'s driving, and (c) where you go during your rental. It doesn’t show other over-the-counter costs, such as charges for fuel, child seats or additional services.
Fines

You are responsible for any charges and fines, including tolls, congestion charges, speeding tickets and parking or traffic fines.
Mandatory Coverage

At the car hire counter, you may decide to buy additional cover to reduce or remove your excess, or to cover things your Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) doesn\'t, such as tyres and windscreen.
Please note: If you do, the contract will be between you and the rental company – so you’ll need to contact them if you\'re dissatisfied with the policy or the cover it provides.
Additional drivers

The main driver (the person named on the booking) must be present when you pick the car up, and must be the one who pays anything charged at the counter. There may be a daily fee for additional drivers. The rental terms, including age-related restrictions and fees, apply to any additional drivers.
Roadside assistance

You may have to pay extra for any emergency roadside assistance that your rental company provides. When you pick your car up, please make sure you find out where the relevant paperwork is kept. In most cases, it’ll be in the glove box or attached to the sun visor.
Additional Fees at Drop-off
After your rental

After your rental

If you’ve incurred any charges, such as speeding tickets or unpaid congestion charges, the car hire company will try to contact you when the authorities ask them who was driving. This could be months after your rental – and you’ll have to pay the company’s administration fee as well as the original charge.
Other Fees
DVLA Fee

If this applies to you, the cost is £18.00 including tax per rental.'

Licence Requirements

When picking the car up, the main driver and any additional drivers will need to provide a full driving licence in their name.

Digital driving licences will not be accepted.

If you’ve had your driving licence renewed and it only shows the date it was renewed, you’ll need to prove when it was originally issued.

All drivers must have held their driving licence for at least 2 years.

You might not be able to rent a car if any of the following apply:

    You’ve committed any driving offences
    You hold penalty points or have endorsements on your driver’s licence
    You’ve ever committed any offences relating to alcohol or drug use

If any of the above applies, please contact the rental branch before pick-up to confirm if you will be allowed to rent a car.

It is each driver’s responsibility to find out what paperwork they need before driving in another country. For example, you may need a visa and/or International Driving Permit as well as your driving licence.

Driving licenses printed with non Roman Alphabet (Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Cyrillic etc) must be complemented by an international driver’s license. For driver’s licenses from countries not part of the international driver’s license treaty, an official translation of the license must be presented with the original license.
DVLA Clauses & Rules

If you hold a UK driving licence, the counter staff may need to check your driving record when you pick your car up. So we strongly recommend you get a licence ‘check code’ from the DVLA before you go to pick your car up:

    Visit www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence and click ‘Start now’
    Enter your driving licence number, National Insurance number & postcode
    Tick the ‘I agree’ box and click ‘View now’
    Click ‘Get your check code’
    Click ‘Get a code’
    Write down your code – or click ‘Print or save a driving summary’

The code is only valid for 21 days – but once you’ve picked your car up, you won’t need it anymore. So all you have to do is make sure you get your code less than three weeks before your pick-up date.
Forms of identification

At the counter, you’ll need to provide:

Each driver’s full, valid driving licence

Your rental voucher

Customers who cannot provide return flight ticket will be processed as local renters.
Additional documents

Each driver’s passport

Proof of the main driver’s home address

A current utility bill in the main driver’s name
Rules around IDs

You’ll need to provide one of the following: (a) an airline boarding pass, (b) a train ticket, or (c) a ferry ticket. This must be for your return journey, and must show your departure time and date.

Any utility bill or bank statement must have been issued no more than 4 months before you pick up your car.

Some occupations such as professional sports people, entertainers, taxi / delivery drivers or foreign service and military personnel are excluded from the insurance policy. This is also applicable for students under the age of 25, please enquire with the renting branch before booking.
Rental Voucher / eVoucher

At pick-up, the car hire company will require EITHER a printed copy of the customer’s voucher OR an eVoucher. If this is not presented, the car hire company may not allow the car to be picked up, or may charge again for the rental.

When you booked your car, you booked a certain make and model ‘or similar’ (‘similar’ means same gearbox, similar size, similar engine, etc.). The counter staff may provide a different car - not the exact make and model that you were expecting.
Age Requirements

To drive this car, you must be at least 25.

To drive this car, you must be under the age of 81.
Arrival details

If you are arriving by plane, the car hire company needs your arrival flight number at least 3 days before your rental is due to start. If you do not provide your flight number, the car hire company cannot be held responsible if your plane is delayed and as a result your car is not available. Please ensure that you enter your flight number and not any other number the airline may have sent you, such as a confirmation number.

If your flight is delayed, please call the rental counter during their opening hours.'

When you pick the car up, please make sure you read any terms and conditions before signing the rental agreement, including any terms of additional products you may purchase at the counter. It’s very important that you understand the agreement/policy’s exclusions and limits, as well as the rules about anything you pay for at the rental counter.
Deposit / Excess

The car has a theft excess of £2,505.00 including tax.

The rental company will require a security deposit of £2,505.00 when you pick your car up. The deposit will be returned after the rental, as long as all conditions have been met.

The car has a damage excess of £2,505.00 including tax.

When you pick your car up, the counter staff will require a security deposit for the car. They may also require a security deposit for fuel in the tank and for certain extras (e.g. a child seat or GPS). After your rental, your deposit(s) will be returned.

Due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates and other possible banking charges, the car hire company cannot be held responsible for any difference between the amount paid and the amount refunded.

The Collision Damage Waiver and Theft Protection policies come with an ‘excess’. The excess is the amount that you will need to pay before the policy covers the rest of the cost (for anything the policy covers).

If you buy ‘Reduced excess,’ it reduces the applicable Collision Damage Waiver and Theft excess amounts. It excludes things such as windscreens, undercarriage, interior, personal belongings, towing charges, and off-road time—as well as any ‘extra equipment’ hired from the car hire company, such as child seats and GPS devices.

Please note that your cover will be invalidated by negligence, refuelling errors, breaking the terms of the rental agreement, or breaking the law (for example, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs).

You may find that the rental agreement you receive at the rental counter refers to ‘Reduced excess’ by a different name. If it does, this will not affect how it works.

For more information about full exclusions, please refer to your rental agreement.

Reduced excess is not insurance.
Additional Cover

At the car hire counter, you may decide to buy additional cover to reduce or remove your excess, or to cover things your Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) doesn’t, such as tyres and windscreen.
Please note: If you do, the contract will be between you and the rental company – so you’ll need to contact them if you’re dissatisfied with the policy or the cover it provides.

If you’re involved in a ’single vehicle accident’ and/or the bodywork is particularly badly damaged, the excess will be higher.
Cover Arrangements

Please make sure you read the terms and conditions of the cover you receive when signing the rental agreement at pick-up, to find out about the policy’s exclusions and limits.
Policies normally exclude things such as windscreens, glass, wheels, tyres, undercarriage, interior, personal belongings, towing charges & off-road time – as well as any ‘extra equipment’ hired from the car hire company, such as child seats and GPS devices.
Note that your cover will be invalidated by negligence, refuelling errors or breaking the terms of the rental agreement (for example, by driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs).
Administration Charges

Damage to the car will be charged for by the car hire company after it is dropped off - and will incur a Damage Administration fee on top of the amount deducted from the excess.

An Immobilisation Charge is payable in the event of an accident. This is in addition to the amount deducted from the excess and is compulsory. This charge is calculated against the car group and the number of repair days.

If the car is damaged or stolen, the rental company will charge an administration fee. If you pay for damage/theft with a credit card, they’ll charge an additional administration fee.

Once the rental is completed, customers need to return to the rental office to ask for a refund of the deposit. The deposit has to be repaid against the same payment card originally used.'

Like for like

When you pick your car up, the fuel tank will be full or partly full. You will leave a deposit to cover the cost of the fuel: the counter staff will block this money on your credit card. Just before you return your car, please replace the fuel you’ve used.

The fuel tank will be either full or part-full. When you pick the car up, please check how much fuel there is. On return, as long as you’ve replaced the fuel you’ve used, you’ll pay no fuel fees.

If you return your car with less fuel than it had when you picked it up, the car hire company will keep some or all of your deposit to cover the missing fuel. The cost of the missing fuel will be based on the supplier’s current price per litre. This may cost you more than you would pay to refill the tank yourself.

If there’s any fuel missing when you drop your car off, you’ll be charged both a refuelling fee and the cost of the missing fuel (at the current market price per litre/gallon).
E-cars

Vehicles are supplied with a minimum of 80% battery charge and should be returned with the same percentage battery charge. Hirers are recommended to return the car with the same battery charge to avoid charges. In the event the vehicle has been returned with less battery charge than it was provided with, a charge of £0.50 will apply for every 1% under the agreed return battery charge level.'

Overseas mileage is limited to 100 miles per day. Mileage over the agreed amount with be charged at £0.30 per mile. Any unlimited mileage package applies to travel in the UK only.

Permission for use in Ireland or on the continent and France will incur additional fees.

Rental extensions

If you need the car, including any extras, for longer than originally agreed, please call the pick-up counter (you’ll find their phone number on your rental agreement). If you don’t give them enough notice, there may be a penalty fee on top of the additional cost.

At the rental counter, customers will also sign a rental agreement before they give you the key. It’s important that you read that agreement carefully - and if anything isn’t clear, discuss it with the counter staff before you sign.

You rental company reserves the right to refuse a car if, in the counter staff’s opinion, the driver is unfit to drive or anyone in the group is threatening, abusive or in any way endangering the health and safety of other people. If this happens, you will not be entitled to any refund or compensation.

Please see ‘What you need at pick-up’ above - and note that the counter staff will not provide a car unless all requirements (age, driving licence, payment card, documentation, etc.) are met. If this happens, you will not be entitled to any refund or compensation.

Before you drive off, you must check the car and make sure that any damage is reported to the counter staff and noted on the rental agreement. Otherwise, you may end up being liable for that damage.

Seatbelt - Whatever country you’re driving in, driver and passengers must wear seatbelts if fitted, wherever they’re sitting in the car.

Please be aware that all cars have a non-smoking policy. Fines will apply if this policy is not adhered to.

To make sure you understand the rules and laws about driving hire cars at home and abroad, it’s essential you read the Terms & Conditions in full before you leave to pick your car up.

In particular, please make sure you know what documents and other paperwork you must take with you (e.g. driving licence, forms of identification, and payment cards) and what you’ll need to pay for at the car hire counter. If you don’t have everything you need, the car hire company may not let you pick the car up.

If you intend to do any city driving, there may be traffic restrictions based on your car’s licence plate, so please tell the counter staff when you go to pick up your car.
On the road

Accident or Breakdown - In the event of a breakdown, accident or mechanical difficulties, you must call the car hire company immediately. They must give authority for repairs or replacement cars. Please keep copies of all documentation you are asked to complete. This may be needed if you wish to make a claim. For accidents, a police report and an incident report from the car hire counter will be required.

If you are having any problems with your rental car, please call the rental company.
Car Hire Company Important Information

If the hirer fails to return the vehicle within the specified time, a penalty charge will apply and the hirer will be black listed (declined for future bookings).
Price calculation

Please note that exchange rates can fluctuate - and no-one in the car rental industry can do anything about this. As a result, you might find that charges on your statement aren’t an exact match with the price you were told while booking. The same goes for any refund you may receive.

Price Calculation - Prices are based on the pick-up and drop-off times and dates that you agree before your rental starts. If you pick the car up any later or bring it back any earlier, you will not receive a refund for unused time.

If, at pick-up, you choose to take a different car, there may be an additional charge for this – even if the new car is smaller than the one you had booked.
Penalty fees

An Immobilisation Charge is payable in the event of an accident. This is in addition to the amount deducted from the excess and is compulsory. This charge is calculated against the car group and the number of repair days.

Lost Keys - If you lose your key(s), you will be charged the cost of replacement.

If you’ve not returned the car after your agreed drop-off time, the insurance will no longer be valid. Plus, you will be charged a penalty fee as well as the cost of another day’s rental.
Grace period

You must be at the rental counter by your pick-up time: if you’re late, the car may no longer be available, and you won’t be entitled to a refund. If you think you might be late, it’s vital that you contact the rental company at least 30 minutes before your pick-up time, even if it’s because of a flight delay and you’ve provided your flight number.

Please note that the car hire company will hold your car for the indicated grace period ONLY during office opening hours. If you are late and you arrive at the location after the car hire company closes, you will not be able to collect your vehicle and cancellation charges will apply.

There will be a 59-minute grace period for the return of all vehicles. If the car is returned after this time the insurance will no longer be valid and the customer will have to pay the late penalty fee + the daily rate.

Reservations will be held for 4 hours from the specified reservation time after which they will be classed as a no-show. If the hirer arrives after this time or if the rental station closes in the interim, then a vehicle is not assured. Green Motion will do everything possible to provide a vehicle. This may include offering a different vehicle and rates may be different to the original booking. In the event of a no-show, the booking is non-refundable.
Valeting

The car hire company will charge you if the car needs more than a reasonable amount of cleaning after your rental.',
